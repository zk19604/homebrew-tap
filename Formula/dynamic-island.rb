# downloaded as a binary, never gets the quarantine flag, and needs no
# paid Apple Developer account (it is ad-hoc signed during the build).

      dynamic-island.app was installed to:
        #{opt_prefix}/dynamic-island.app

      To make it show up in Launchpad/Spotlight, link it into ~/Applications:
        mkdir -p ~/Applications
        ln -sf "#{opt_prefix}/dynamic-island.app" ~/Applications/dynamic-island.app

      Launch it with:
        open "#{opt_prefix}/dynamic-island.app"

      "Launch at Login" (menu bar icon) registers the app at its current path.
      Re-enable it after `brew upgrade dynamic-island` if it stops starting at login.
